Plan:
[x] Split monolithic script to xrd,ued,io OR physics, io
[x] Use classes for each subsection
[x] Parser to have time-resolved, static signal and we can input either geom/traj does not matter
[ ] Check the physics 
    [x]xrd [x]ued single point for one geometry
    [x]xrd [x]ued difference between two geometries
    [ ]xrd [ ]ued time-resolved signal from trajectory
    [ ]xrd [ ]ued time-resolved signal from ensemble
[ ] Form factor db restructuralize
[ ] Correct momentum transfer labels q, s

Additional: 
[ ] Log to file option, debug option
[ ] Better plotting
[ ] Write tests
[ ] Handling oscillatory sinc behavior for diff at long distances
