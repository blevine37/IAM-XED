# Plan
- [x] Split monolithic script to xrd,ued,io OR physics, io
- [x] Use classes for each subsection
- [x] Parser to have time-resolved, static signal and we can input either geom/traj does not matter
- [x] Check the physics 
  - [x] xrd single point for one geometry
  - [x] ued single point for one geometry
  - [x] xrd difference between two geometries
  - [x] ued difference between two geometries
  - [x] xrd time-resolved signal from trajectory
  - [x] ued time-resolved signal from trajectory
  - [x] xrd time-resolved signal from ensemble
  - [x] ued time-resolved signal from ensemble
- [ ] Form factor db restructuralize
- [ ] Correct momentum transfer labels q, s
- [ ] Checking units in plot labels

### Additional: 
- [x] Log to file option, debug option
- [ ] Better plotting
- [x] Write tests
- [ ] Handling oscillatory sinc behavior for diff at long distances
- [ ] Exporting data in other then atomic units
- [ ] PDF for XRD
- [ ] Citations should include IAM data sources
